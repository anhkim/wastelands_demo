## Wastelands
a recyclable-collection app for OutsideLands Hackathon 2014

Wastelands is an app to serve a simple need:
help organizers and music festival fans keep the Golden Gate Park clean.

Trash is a major problem at Outside Lands and other music festivals. Our goal is to streamline   cleanup by getting the crowd involved to compete for boss schwag and bragging rights.
(And plenty of prizes, such as VIP tickets to more rock festivals for participants.)
